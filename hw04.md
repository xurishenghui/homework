* Color

  Color (American English) or colour (Commonwealth English) is the characteristic of human visual perception described through color categories, with names such as red, orange, yellow, green, blue, or purple. This perception of color derives from the stimulation of cone cells in the human eye by electromagnetic radiation in the visible spectrum. Color categories and physical specifications of color are associated with objects through the wavelength of the light that is reflected from them. This reflection is governed by the object's physical properties such as light absorption, emission spectra, etc.
  颜色（美式英语）或颜色（英联邦英语）是通过颜色类别描述的人类 视觉感知的特征，其名称为红色，橙色，黄色，绿色，蓝色或紫色。颜色的这种看法由刺激导出视锥细胞在人眼通过电磁辐射在可见光谱。颜色类别和颜色的物理规格通过从它们反射的光的波长与对象相关联。这种反射受物体的物理特性控制，如光吸收，发射光谱等。
